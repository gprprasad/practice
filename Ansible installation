INSTALLING ANSIBLE IN UBUNTU :
The best way to get Ansible for Ubuntu is to add the project's PPA (personal package archive) to your system.
First we need to install "software-properties-common" package,which will give us to give ability to work with PPA easily.
First we need to update the packages in ubuntu by using 
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
After installing the package we can add ansible PPA by following cmd i.e.,
   $ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible PRESS ENTER to accept PPA addition.
After that we can update packages and install ansible
    $  sudo apt-get update
    $  sudo apt-get install ansible
 then check the ansible version in your meachine by using 
    $ ansible --version
