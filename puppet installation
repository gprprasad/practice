install puppet on ubuntu
requirements:minimun 1 GB of memory and puppet takse by default 2 GB of RAM for installation.
Before we install puppet,we need to install NTP(Network time protocal)
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y install ntp
$ sudo service ntp start
INSTALL PUPPET SERVER 
$ cd ~ && wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
$ sudo apt-get update
Install the puppetserver package
$ sudo apt-get -y install puppetserver (Puppetserver is just installed,not yet started)
By default the puppet takes 2GB RAM size.If you want to extend that do some change in configuration file,then to open conf file run this cmd
$ sudo vi /etc/default/puppetserver In this conf file find out the JAVA_ARGS line,use "-Xms" and "-Xmx" parameters to set the memory allocation
Like ex: JAVA_ARGS="-Xms3g -Xmx3g" save and exit from the editor.then, start the puppet server by using cmd i.e.,
$ sudo service puppetserver restart (if you done changes then do restart,if not no need to restart.)
Enable the puppet server so that it starts when master server boots use below cmd
$ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet resource service puppetserver ensure=running enable=true
NOW INSTALL THE PUPPET AGENT
Enable official puppet labs connection by the following cmds:
$ cd ~ && wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
INSTALL PUPPET AGENT PACKAGE
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install puppet-agent
After installing the puppet agent,start it by using the cmd

SIGN CERTIFICATES ON PUPPET MASTER:-
First time puppet run on agent node.it will send a certificate signing requist to the puppet master before puppet server will communicate with agent node,it must sign that particular agent node.
LIST THE CURRENT CERTIFICATE REQUISTS :
To list the certificates run this cmd on puppet master
$ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert list
SIGN A CERTIFICATE:
To sign a certificate requist,use the puppet "cert sign" cmd with the hostname of certofocate whom to want cmd is 
$ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert sign HOSTNAME
If you want to sign all current requists,then use --all option i.e.,
$ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert sign --all
If you want to remove a host from puppet or rebuild the host and add it back to puppet.In this case you revoke the certificates from the puppet master then use "clean" option.
The cmd is $ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert clean hostname
View all signed requists,then use
$ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert list --all
