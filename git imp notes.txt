 Basic Branching and Merging
-------------------------------
Let’s go through a simple example of branching and merging with a workflow
that you might use in the real world. You’ll follow these steps:
1. Do work on a web site.
2. Create a branch for a new story you’re working on.
3. Do some work in that branch.
At this stage, you’ll receive a call that another issue is critical and you need a
hotfix. You’ll do the following:
1. Revert back to your production branch.
2. Create a branch to add the hotfix.
3. After it’s tested, merge the hotfix branch, and push to production.
4. Switch back to your original story and continue working.
